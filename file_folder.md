2. **Quick Open:**
   - Use `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+P` (Mac) to open the Quick Open dialog. Start typing the name of the file you want to open, and VS Code will provide a list of matching files.

4. **Go to Definition/Implementation:**
   - Use `F12` or right-click and select `Go to Definition` to navigate to the definition of a function, variable, or class. Use `Ctrl+F12` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F12` (Mac) to go to the implementation.

5. **Explorer Navigation Shortcuts:**
   - `Ctrl+B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+B` (Mac) to toggle the Explorer pane.
   - `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Alt+Left` and `Cmd+Alt+Right` (Mac) to navigate backward and forward in the file history.
